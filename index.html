	<h1> My motivation that makes me want to study online</h1>
	<p style="color: purple;"> My name is Nik Shamimi Binti Sanusi. What makes me want to study online is because i don't want to graduate late. beside that all lecturers also encaourage for student to study online</p>

	<p> Next, my motivation to study online is because my university which is UITM had told that all students should be study online to stop this pandemic. It was for everyone safety.</p>

	<p> My goal is also to score 4flat so that is why i am also motivated in studying online. Although all the test and quiz are killing me but i still want to study online because i want to achieve my goals.</p>

	<p> The person that motivated me the most in studying online is MY PARENTS. They always gave me support to keep studying and success in life.</p> 

	<h1 style="border:3px solid black">I AM SO THANKFUL TO HAVE MY PARENTS IN MY LIFE</h1>

	<p>My life motto is:<q>Do The Things That Make You Happy, Ignore Others</q>

	<p>The <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi MARA">UiTM</abbr> was the best university</p>

	<h1 style="border:5px dotted yellow"> That's all my motivation</h1>
